<objective>
Build the generation UI components: a trigger button that validates Q&A completeness, a progress orchestrator that generates sections sequentially with streaming text display, and integrate the generation view into the existing bid workspace.

Purpose: This plan creates the complete user-facing generation experience. After Q&A completion, users click "Generate Bid" and watch as each section streams professional narrative text in real-time. This is the core UX of Phase 5.
Output: Three new components and one modified workspace component providing the complete generation UI.

  <name>Task 1: Create generation UI components (trigger, progress, section display)</name>
  <files>
    src/app/dashboard/tenders/[id]/bid/components/generation-trigger.tsx
    src/app/dashboard/tenders/[id]/bid/components/generation-progress.tsx
    src/app/dashboard/tenders/[id]/bid/components/generated-section.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Create `generation-trigger.tsx` ('use client'):
    - Props: { questions: Question[], answers: Record<string, unknown>, onGenerate: () => void, disabled?: boolean }
    - Import validateBidCompleteness from @/lib/bids/validation
    - Calculate completeness using validateBidCompleteness(answers, questions)
    - Render a styled container (border-2 border-black p-6 bg-white) with:
      - Heading: "Generate Professional Bid" (font-display text-xl)
      - Description text explaining the action
      - If not complete: show warning count of unanswered required questions (text-yellow-700)
      - Button using @/components/ui/button: disabled when !completeness.complete or disabled prop
      - Button shows Sparkles icon + "Generate Bid" text, or Loader2 spinner + "Generating..." when disabled
    - Use Sparkles and Loader2 from lucide-react

    Create `generated-section.tsx` ('use client'):
    - Props: { section: BidSection, content: string | undefined, status: 'pending' | 'generating' | 'complete' }
    - Import BidSection type from @/lib/bids/sections
    - Render a section container with border-2 border-black:
      - Header bar with section.title and status indicator:
        - pending: gray Circle icon + "Waiting..." text
        - generating: Loader2 spinner (animate-spin) + "Generating..." text
        - complete: CheckCircle2 icon (text-green-600) + "Complete" text
      - Content area:
        - pending: empty / minimal height placeholder
        - generating: show partial content + blinking cursor (animate-pulse "▋")
        - complete: show full content
    - Content rendered with whitespace-pre-wrap for markdown-like formatting
    - Use editorial design: sharp corners, strong borders, monochrome + check icon green

    Create `generation-progress.tsx` ('use client'):
    - Props: { answers: Record<string, unknown>, tenderTitle: string, bidId: string, onComplete: (generatedContent: Record<string, string>) => void }
    - Import BID_SECTIONS, getAnswersForSection from @/lib/bids/sections
    - Import generateBidSection from @/lib/bids/mock-generator
    - Import saveGeneratedBid from @/actions/bids
    - Import GeneratedSection component
    - State: currentSectionIndex (number), generatedContent (Record<string, string>), sectionStatuses (Record<string, 'pending' | 'generating' | 'complete'>), isGenerating (boolean)
    - On mount (useEffect with empty deps), start generation sequence:
      1. Set isGenerating = true
      2. For each section in BID_SECTIONS sequentially:
        a. Set section status to 'generating'
        b. Get section answers via getAnswersForSection
        c. Call generateBidSection to get ReadableStream
        d. Read stream with reader.getReader(), accumulate text, update generatedContent state on each chunk (triggers re-render showing streaming text)
        e. On stream complete: set section status to 'complete', release reader lock
        f. Move to next section
      3. After all sections complete: call saveGeneratedBid to persist, call onComplete with final generatedContent
    - Stream cleanup: use isMounted ref pattern. In useEffect cleanup, set isMounted = false.
    - Render: map over BID_SECTIONS, render GeneratedSection for each with current content and status
    - Show overall progress: "{completedCount}/{BID_SECTIONS.length} sections generated" text

    Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Verify all three component files exist and are properly formatted React client components with 'use client' directive.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Three generation UI components exist: trigger button with completeness validation, section display with three visual states, and progress orchestrator that streams sections sequentially with ReadableStream consumption and proper cleanup.

  <name>Task 2: Integrate generation view into bid workspace</name>
  <files>
    src/app/dashboard/tenders/[id]/bid/components/bid-workspace.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Modify `bid-workspace.tsx` to add a generation view alongside the existing Q&A view:

    1. Add state: `view` with type 'questions' | 'generating' | 'preview' (default: 'questions')
    2. Add state: `generatedSections` (Record<string, string>) to store generated content after completion

    3. After the existing "Submit for Review" button area, add the GenerationTrigger component:
      - Only show when view === 'questions' AND allRequiredAnswered is true
      - onGenerate handler: sets view to 'generating'
      - disabled when view !== 'questions'

    4. When view === 'generating':
      - Hide the QuestionCard and question navigation
      - Show GenerationProgress component instead
      - Pass answers, tender.title, bid.id, and onComplete callback
      - onComplete callback: stores generatedSections, sets view to 'preview'

    5. When view === 'preview':
      - Show all generated sections rendered with their content (simple display of generatedSections)
      - Show a "Back to Questions" button that sets view back to 'questions'
      - Show a "Regenerate" button that sets view to 'generating' and clears generatedSections

    6. Keep all existing Q&A functionality (auto-save, navigation, progress) working when view === 'questions'
    7. Import GenerationTrigger and GenerationProgress from their respective files
    8. The existing Submit for Review button should remain visible in preview view (after generation is done)
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Verify bid-workspace.tsx imports GenerationTrigger and GenerationProgress correctly. Verify the view state toggles between 'questions', 'generating', and 'preview'.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Bid workspace now has three views: Q&A questions (existing), generating (streaming progress), and preview (showing generated content). Users flow from answering questions → clicking Generate → watching generation → reviewing output.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
2. generation-trigger.tsx renders Generate Bid button with completeness validation
3. generated-section.tsx renders three visual states (pending/generating/complete) correctly
4. generation-progress.tsx orchestrates sequential section generation with streaming
5. bid-workspace.tsx has three-view state machine (questions → generating → preview)
6. All imports between new and existing files resolve correctly
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User can see Generate Bid button after completing required Q&A questions
- Clicking Generate shows section-by-section streaming generation
- Each section transitions through pending → generating → complete states
- Generated content is saved to database via saveGeneratedBid
- User can view generated content in preview mode
- User can navigate back to questions or regenerate
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-ai-bid-generation/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
